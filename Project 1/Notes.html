        5 <em>Thinking</em> Methods
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          It's imprtant to remember that when you are inteh planning stages of writing
          your code, that you need to <em>think</em> like a computer.  Since computers are <em>"so smart"</em>, they will literally do exactly as you tell them to.  This makes them very 
          unforgiving since a small mistake by a 
          programmer can cause huge problems in a program.
          <br>Here are 5 methods to consider:
          <div class="concept-bullet-bold-indent">
              <p>1. Procedural Thinking
              <br>2. Abstract Thinking

              <br>4. Technological Empathy

        What is a Web Page
      </div>
    <div class="concept-description">
     <p>
      A web page is a text document written in a language called HTML. Web browsers read these documents, and then interpret them to display text, images, graphics and videos as defined in your .css file.  We will go through CSS and what that does later.

        How Coding Works
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          For our purposes when refering to a programmer, we will betalking about HTML coding.  A programmers write text or a set of instructions, in a language that a computer can understand.  he Programer will incorporate <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/"><b>HTML Tags</b></a> to give text different colors or fonts. HTML Tags are the hidden keywords or values within a web page that define how the browser must format and display the content. Most tags must have two parts, an opening and closing.

        Forgetting Something?

      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          It's okay to forget!  Often I found myself googling anything and everythign related to HTML coding (and still do).  If you're like me and not someone who programs all the time, you'll find yourself using google and other useful sites to figure out how to code <a href="http://html-color-codes.info/"><b>something</b></a> correctly.

            <b>CSS</b> or <b>C</b>ascading <b>S</b>tyle <b>S</b>heet is code written to control the "<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference">style</a>" of HTML elements.  CSS helps define font, size, color, spacing, border and location of HTML information on a web page, and can also be used to create a continuous look throughout multiple pages of a website.

          <div class="concept-bullet-points">
            <br><b>1. Write CSS in the head of your HTML</b> - Good for small projects as you will be able to write the the CSS above the text that you want to display.
            <br><b>2. Link your HTML to a separate CSS file</b> - projects as you will be able to create tags in a seperate .css file which your HTML will call.
            <br><b>3. Write your style inline with your HTML</b> - Probabaly the worst way to give style to your HTML as this will create a lot of repeated code.  if you find yourself doing this, you may want to take a step back and think about your approach to the entire project.

        Orgainzing your Code

      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          One of the hardest things to keep straight is that your code should be and needs to be kept neat and orgaized in a "tree" like structure.  The image below is an example of the code used to write this section of the page.  The program used to write that is <a href="www.sublimetext.com/2">Sublime Test 2</a>.
